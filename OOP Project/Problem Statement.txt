Problem Statement:
We need to develop and implement a hostel management system that automates and simplifies the operational management of the hostel. The system should provide functions to efficiently handle room allocation, meal planning, maintenance requests, and administrative tasks. It should meet the needs of hotel managers and residents, provide a user-friendly way to access and manage information about the hostel. The system should include student/staff information, room availability presence, meal schedules, maintenance requests, and employee activity records. Additionally, measures need to be added to ensure transparency, resource efficiency, and improve overall hostel management. The goal is to create robust and comprehensive solutions that streamline hostel management processes and improve efficiency and comfort for allÂ stakeholders.
